            <p>The Future Manufacturing Africa Trade Fair and Summit (FMA), is the only trade show in Africa focusing on the full manufacturing value chain for the African continent.  Being the world’s second-largest and second-most populous continent, Africa is full of opportunities especially in the manufacturing industry. Current policies and agreements promise significant gains, including economic diversification, structural transformation, technological development and job creation.  Forecasts with regards to the new policies and reforms predict $1,2 billion consumer market spend for African businesses, $4 trillion in estimated private and business to business spend and the creation of 13 million to 16 million new jobs.  The World Bank predicts that by 2025 the volume of total exports of manufactured goods will increase by 29%, while Intra-Africa manufacturing trade climbs to 110% and manufacturing exports to the rest of the world rise with 46%.
                Poised to help you capitalise on these opportunities, FMA2023 provides an effective platform for companies to introduce new innovations and solutions to strategic decision makers from Africa.
                Participating in FMA2023, will help you connect with decision makers who are serious about investing or building new manufacturing plants, procuring the latest innovations in machinery, equipment and technology as well as finding turnkey solutions to improve their existing production output.
                et to take place at the Johannesburg Expo Centre (Nasrec), South Africa, from 9 – 11 May, the Future Manufacturing Africa Trade Fair and Summit is an event not to be missed </p>
